                    Hi there! My name is Glenn Eirik Hansen, and I am a fullstack web developer. I am an enthusiastic and kind guy that
                    that want's the best out of his life. As of writing this, I am studying Web Development at NTNU and is currently writing
                    my bachelor thesis. On the private side, I am very interested in airplanes and is currently working towards my pilots license.
                    Music is also a big passion in my life, I play the drums, but can also play the guitar, bass and keyboard somewhat... (I won't call myself a pro though...)
                    My favorite genre is metal and favorite band is the "Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte"-band Rammstein. I also love the smell and fresh air of nature,
                    going on camping trips is a lot of fun. Some may say I am a gun nut, as I am participating in IPSC (International Practical Shooting Confederation),
                    where I am a certified Range Officer.
                </p>
                <p>As you can see, I am quite the active person with a lot of hobbies and interests! While you're here, check out my projects below ;)</p>
